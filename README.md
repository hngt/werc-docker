# Docker image for werc

Just a quick image I made for werc. It uses alpine, lighttpd and 9base. Discount markdown is used for formatting.

Used a bit from [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spujadas/lighttpd-docker) for setting up lighttpd.

It just works, the site files are in sites/ directory.
